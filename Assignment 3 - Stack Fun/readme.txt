You must do these programs by yourself.
The programs must be done using a Linux environment. Note: Your code must compile and run on kamek.ece.utexas.edu.
The programs must be modular, with significant work done by functions. Each function should perform a single, well-defined task. When possible, create re-usable functions. Do not write trivial functions such as a function to read a single value from an input file.
You must place appropriate functions in a library. You will be given a starting Stack ADT header file. Don't change the function definitions in the .h file.
You will be turning in two zipped projects.
We should be able to read a "readme.txt" file (for instructions on how to make and run the program), unzip the file, and type "make" to compile and link the project.
Turn in: Two sets of files that include: readme.txt (gives instructions for unzipping and running code), driver.c, stack312_??.c, stack312_??.h, and a makefile (you must write your own makefile). The "??" will either be the "ll" or the "arr" version of the stack implementation.

Upload: Turn in two zipped files named prog03list_xxxxx.zip and prog03array_xxxxx.zip, where xxxxxx is your UT EID to Canvas.
